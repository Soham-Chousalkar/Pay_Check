# PayTracker - Pay Check Project Progress Report
# Date: Current Session
# Status: 90% Complete - Core Features Working

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
A React-based time tracking and earnings calculator application with advanced panel management, grouping systems, and infinite canvas capabilities.

## COMPLETED FEATURES ‚úÖ

### 1. CORE APPLICATION STRUCTURE
- React + Vite setup with hot module replacement
- Component-based architecture (App, PanelWrapper, EarningsPanel, RetroDigital)
- Custom hooks for state management (useHistory, useCanvas, usePanelManagement)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### 2. PANEL SYSTEM
- Dynamic panel creation and deletion
- Drag-and-drop functionality with snapping
- Real-time earnings calculation
- Editable panel titles and hourly rates
- Timer controls (start/pause/stop)
- Panel state persistence

### 3. CANVAS MANAGEMENT
- Multiple canvas support
- Canvas library with rename/delete operations
- Canvas switching without losing panel states
- Canvas creation and deletion with undo/redo support
- Canvas persistence and snapshots

### 4. UNDO/REDO SYSTEM
- Full history management (50 entries)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y)
- Button-based undo/redo controls
- History for all major operations (panel creation, deletion, movement, canvas operations)

### 5. ZOOM SYSTEM
- Infinite zoom out (1% minimum)
- High zoom in (1000% maximum)
- Smooth mouse wheel zooming
- Zoom state persistence

### 6. SETTINGS SYSTEM
- Hamburger menu button (‚ò∞) that transforms to left arrow (‚Üê) when open
- Left-sliding settings panel
- Panel opacity control (0-100%) with real-time updates
- Background image upload and management
- Settings persistence (until database integration)

### 7. DEBUG SYSTEM
- Debug window with action/reaction logging
- Smart log combining for similar actions within 2-second windows
- Draggable debug interface
- Console flood prevention
- Action tracking for all user interactions

### 8. GROUPING SYSTEM
- 25% overlap threshold for panel grouping (improved sensitivity)
- Group creation when panels are dragged over each other
- Visual feedback: translucent background panel appears behind overlapping panels
- Group earnings summation in real-time (sum of all panel earnings)
- Editable group titles with total earnings always visible
- Groups appear as containers around the actual panels (no separate left panels)
- Individual panels maintain their timers and rates within groups
- Panel removal: drag panels out of group to ungroup them
- Group management: delete group or undo grouping via confirmation dialog
- Clean, intuitive grouping similar to modern browser tab grouping

### 9. PANEL TRANSPARENCY
- Background and border transparency based on opacity slider
- Text and interactive elements remain fully opaque
- Real-time transparency updates
- Smooth visual transitions

### 10. UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS
- Cursor symbols fixed (text cursor for editable fields)
- Button spacing and positioning optimized
- Visual feedback for all interactive elements
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive layout design

### Key Algorithms
- **Overlap Detection**: 30% area overlap threshold for grouping
- **Earnings Calculation**: Real-time based on accumulated time and hourly rate
- **History Management**: Single entry per complex operation
- **Zoom Smoothing**: Threshold-based updates to prevent jitter

### State Management
- React hooks for local state
- Custom hooks for complex logic
- State persistence through component lifecycle
- Optimized re-renders with useCallback and useMemo

## CURRENT WORKING FEATURES

### ‚úÖ Fully Functional
1. Panel creation, editing, and deletion
2. Canvas management and switching
3. Undo/redo system (keyboard and buttons)
4. Zoom system (infinite out, high in)
5. Settings panel with opacity and background controls
6. Debug window with smart logging
7. Panel grouping with 30% overlap threshold
8. Panel transparency (background and borders)
9. Background image upload and display
10. Real-time earnings calculation

### üîß Recently Fixed Issues
1. Duplicate function declarations resolved
2. Function dependency order corrected
3. Missing zoom constants added
